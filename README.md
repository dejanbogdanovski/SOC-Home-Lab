# SOC Home Lab: Threat Detection & Analysis with Splunk & Sysmon

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a **SOC Home Lab environment** designed to simulate a real-world cyberattack and perform **threat detection and analysis** using **Sysmon** and **Splunk SIEM**.

The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience in **threat detection engineering**, **endpoint telemetry collection**, **log analysis**, and **adversary activity mapping** within a controlled and isolated environment.

---

## Objectives

- Simulate a realistic attack scenario
- Collect detailed endpoint telemetry using Sysmon
- Centralize and analyze logs with Splunk SIEM
- Detect malicious activity and extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Practice blue-team detection and investigation workflows

---

## Technical Stack

### Virtualization
- **Hypervisor:** Oracle VirtualBox

### Operating Systems
- **Victim Machine:** Windows 10  
- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux  

### Security & Monitoring Tools
- Splunk Enterprise  
- Sysmon (System Monitor)

### Attack Tools
- Metasploit Framework  
  - msfvenom  
  - msfconsole  

---

## Lab Architecture & Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

- Provisioned an isolated **NAT network (10.0.2.0/24)**
- Ensured malware execution occurs safely without exposing the host system or external network

---

### 2. Telemetry Configuration

- Installed and configured **Sysmon** on the Windows 10 victim machine
- Enabled advanced logging for:
  - Process creation
  - File creation
  - Network connections
- Forwarded Sysmon logs to a centralized **Splunk** instance

---

### 3. Adversary Simulation

- Generated a custom reverse shell payload (`Resume.pdf.exe`) on Kali Linux using `msfvenom`
- Hosted the payload via a Python HTTP server
- Executed the payload on the victim machine
- Established a **Command & Control (C2)** connection

---

### 4. Log Analysis & Detection

- Used **Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)** to hunt for suspicious activity
- Investigated:
  - Malicious process execution
  - File creation events
  - Download source URLs
  - File hashes

---

## Key Results & Evidence

This lab highlights the visibility gap filled by **Sysmon and Splunk** in endpoint detection.

### Process Identification
- Identified the malicious process **`Resume.pdf.exe`** running in system memory

### Log Correlation
- Captured **Sysmon Event ID 15 (FileCreateStreamHash)**
- Extracted:
  - Original download source URL
  - Unique file hashes (**MD5 / SHA256**) for forensic analysis

## Skills Demonstrated

- SOC analyst workflow
- Endpoint telemetry collection
- SIEM log ingestion and querying
- Threat hunting using SPL
- Malware execution tracing
- Digital forensics fundamentals
